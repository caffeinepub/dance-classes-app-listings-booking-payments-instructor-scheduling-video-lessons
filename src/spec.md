# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove any instructor photo/portrait rendering from the public-facing Biodata page (/biodata) while keeping the rest of the site unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the /biodata page to not render any instructor portrait/avatar or other images within the page content.
- Ensure /biodata displays only the existing "Biodata" heading plus the two text sections: "Professional Summary" and "Core Competencies".
- Verify the site-wide footer contact section (including its existing circular portrait image and alt text) remains unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting /biodata shows the Biodata heading and the two text sections without any images, broken image links, or empty placeholders; the footer contact portrait still appears as before.
