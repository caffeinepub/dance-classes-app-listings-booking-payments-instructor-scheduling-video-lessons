# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a public Biodata page and move the professional summary content into it.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new public route at `/biodata` with a visible page heading "Biodata".
- On `/biodata`, render two sections: "Professional Summary" (provided paragraph) and "Core Competencies" (four bullet points).
- Add navigation links labeled "Biodata" to `/biodata` in the header (desktop + mobile) and in the footer links.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can navigate to a new "Biodata" page from the header or footer and read the professional summary and core competencies without logging in.
