# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Bharatnatyam dance style option clearly communicate the class frequency in all shared style dropdowns.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the shared dance style options list so the Bharatnatyam option text includes: "2 classes per week (8 per month)".
- Ensure the updated Bharatnatyam text appears anywhere the shared style options list is used (including the class catalog style filter and the Create New Class style selector).
- Verify the updated label/description renders in English without new truncation/overflow beyond existing line-clamp behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** When selecting or filtering by dance style, users will see Bharatnatyam displayed with "2 classes per week (8 per month)" in the relevant dropdowns.
