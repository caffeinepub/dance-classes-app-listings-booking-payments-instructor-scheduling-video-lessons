  "summary": "The diff only modifies project_state.json and does not show any changes to the Biodata (/biodata) page implementation. As a result, the requested removal of the instructor photo/portrait from the Biodata page is not evidenced as implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-56",
      "requirement": "Remove any instructor photo/portrait rendering from the public-facing Biodata page route (/biodata) so the page shows only the \"Biodata\" heading and the two sections (\"Professional Summary\" and \"Core Competencies\"), without any images.",
      "reason": "No frontend route/page/component files for /biodata are modified in the diff; only project metadata is changed, so there is no evidence that any <img> or portrait/avatar rendering was removed from the Biodata page or that placeholders/broken images were addressed.",

      "description": "Updated project metadata/state (project_state.json projectStateVersion/feature listings) unrelated to removing the Biodata page photo.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is specifically about removing an image from the /biodata page and includes constraints about not changing UI component library or backend interfaces; modifying project_state.json is not requested as part of REQ-56 and does not contribute evidence of implementing the requested UI change.",
